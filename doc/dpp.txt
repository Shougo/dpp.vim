INTRODUCTION                                                *dpp-introduction*

*dpp* is the abbreviation of "Dark Powered Plugin manager".  It provides
extensible plugin manager features.

If you don't want to configure plugins, you don't have to use the plugin
manager. It does not work with zero configuration.  You can use other plugin
managers.


==============================================================================
INSTALL                                                          *dpp-install*

NOTE: dpp.vim requires Neovim (0.10.0+) or Vim 9.0.1276+ (latest is
recommended).

Please install both Deno 1.45+ and "denops.vim" v7.0+.

https://deno.land/
https://github.com/vim-denops/denops.vim

NOTE: To install plugins from remote, you need to install "dpp-ext-installer".

https://github.com/Shougo/dpp-ext-installer

NOTE: dpp.vim does not include any extensions.
You must install them you want manually.
You can search dpp.vim plugins from https://github.com/topics/dpp-vim.

		"_" key is executed after all ftplugin.
		"{filetype}" key is executed {filetype} ftplugin.
		"lua_{filetype}" key is executed {filetype} ftplugin as
		|:lua|.
		NOTE: You need to call |dpp#clear_state()| after vimrc is
		changed.

                                                        *dpp-plugin-option-if*
if		(Bool) or (String)

		"plugin/" directory as lazy load plugins.  It is meaningless
		and just increases the overhead.
		NOTE: To load lazy plugins, you need to install
		"dpp-ext-lazy".

		previous settings with the new one.  If the repo tail is bound
		to conflict, you can set the "name" option manually to prevent
		overwriting an existing plugin setting.

HOOKS                                                              *dpp-hooks*

		The string will be split by the lines.
		It is useful for the plugins initialization.

		NOTE: You cannot use function hooks in |dpp#make_state()|.
		NOTE: The loading order is not guaranteed in non lazy plugins.
		NOTE: The string is executed as Ex commands.

		You can use |Vim9| script for hooks.  But you cannot use
		|Vim9| script in global |dpp-plugin-option-hook_add|.  Because
		it may be merged for optimize.

		To use |Vim9| script, you need to use |:vim9script| or |:def|.
		NOTE: |Vim9| script syntax is very strict and it is hard to
		debug.  It is experimental feature.

                                                *dpp-plugin-option-hooks_file*
hooks_file	(String) or (List)
		Hooks file path.  It must be valid path.
		It is useful to define long hooks.

		The file format is:

		{hook_name} {start_marker}
		...
		{end_marker}

		{start_marker} and {end_marker} are from
		|dpp-option-hooksFileMarker|.
		{hook_name} is "hook_xxx" or "lua_xxx" or
		|dpp-plugin-option-ftplugin| filetype.

		Example:
>
		" hook_source {{{
		let g:foo = 'bar'
		" }}}
		" cpp {{{
		let g:bar = 'baz'
		" }}}
		" Use vim9script
		" hook_update {{{
		vim9script
		g:bar = 'baz'
		" }}}
<
                                                  *dpp-plugin-option-hook_add*
hook_add	(String)
		It is executed after the plugin is added.
		It is mainly used for defining mappings.

PLUGINS MERGED FEATURE                                             *dpp-merge*

dpp.vim copies the files of multiple plugins into a single directory and
loads them as plugins by default.  It expects to improve performance.

That path is usually `dpp_INSTALLED_DIR/.cache/init.vim/.dpp`.

Other plugin managers add a plugin path into 'runtimepath' to load external
plugins.  However, if the 'runtimepath' is very large then it will load
slowly.  This is because Vim needs to find and load all 'runtimepath' to load
plugins.  In dpp.vim, this problem does not exist.

The following plugins will not be merged to prevent merge problems
- |dpp-plugin-option-merged| is v:false
- local plugin (dpp-ext-local)
- lazy loaded plugin (|dpp-plugin-option-lazy|)
- uses |dpp-plugin-option-build|
- uses |dpp-plugin-option-hook_post_update|
- uses |dpp-plugin-option-if|

Q: How to donate money to you?

A: I have started github sponsorship to spend more time for Vim/neovim
plugins.  You can donate money to help me!

   https://github.com/sponsors/Shougo

                                                                   *dpp-faq-2*
Q: What means "dark powered"?

A: I think text editor is everything in the world. I want to do everything in
Vim(neovim) like Emacs. It is not allowed by |design-not| in Vim. It is not
the light way to use Vim. So I have defined it as the dark way. I am the dark
Vimmer. My plugins are dark powered.

                                                                   *dpp-faq-3*
Q: Why dpp.vim uses Deno?

A: Deno is asynchronous and faster than Vim script and it can be used in both
Vim and neovim.  The features are what I desired.
I have created some plugins by TypeScript.  The development is very fun and
easy to maintain.

                                                                   *dpp-faq-4*
Q: I want to update cache file automatically when the config is updated.

A: You need to set checkFiles when |dpp#make_state()| and you need to call
|dpp#check_files()| like this.
>
  autocmd BufWritePost *.lua,*.vim,*.toml,*.ts,vimrc,.vimrc
            \ call dpp#check_files()
<

                                                                   *dpp-faq-5*
Q: I want to use dpp functions in lua.

A: You can use |dpp-lua-functions| like this.

>
  lua <<END
  vim.opt.runtimepath:prepend({dpp src path})

  local dpp = require("dpp")

  local dppBase = "~/.cache/dpp"
  if dpp.load_state(dppBase) then
    vim.opt.runtimepath:prepend({denops src path})

    vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("User", {
      pattern = "DenopsReady",
      callback = function()
        vim.notify("dpp load_state() is failed")
        dpp.make_state(dppBase, {TypeScript config file path})
      end,
    })
  end

  vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("User", {
    pattern = "Dpp:makeStatePost",
    callback = function()
      vim.notify("dpp make_state() is done")
    end,
  })
END
<

                                                                   *dpp-faq-6*
Q: |DenopsReady| is not executed when |dpp#min#load_state()| is failed.

A: "plugin/denops.vim" is not loaded.  I think you have enabled "--noplugin".
You need to execute "plugin/denops.vim" manually by |:runtime| command.

>
  runtime! plugin/denops.vim
<

                                                                   *dpp-faq-7*
Q: How to remove the disabled plugins?

A: You can remove them like below.
>
	call map(dpp#check_clean(), { _, val -> delete(val, 'rf') })
<

                                                                   *dpp-faq-8*
Q: Why filetype plugin and detection are disabled in default?

A: Because it is Vim's default behavior.  Some plugin managers and neovim is
default enabled for the features.
But I don't like to enable the feature by default because it affects the
editor performance.  You must explicitly enable it if necessary.
